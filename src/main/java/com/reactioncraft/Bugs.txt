Bugs:

Bookcases:
make it so that Empty Bookcases no longer add enchantment strength to enchantment table (re-add enchantment bonus i removed)

Machines:
Machine Blocks need to be rewrote to use one block instead of two, they need to be updated to use correct textures

Desert Blocks: 
Change bounding boxes of column blocks
Custom sand wont allow doors to be placed on it


Guis: 
crash when making items? and blocks dont show up in inventory
